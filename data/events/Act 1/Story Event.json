Roman Polanski\u2019s masterpiece, Two Men and a Wardrobe (Poland, 1958, 15 min.), is a perfect example of the non-verbal variety, and Polanergergski himself categorically argued that dialogue is out of place in a short film, stating for example: I think that in a short it\u2019s unpleasant to use dialogue. It\u2019s like a piece of a feature film... When you use people in a short, if they talk you expect it\u2019s going to last for two hours. It\u2019s not natural, not proper to the form.[1] Some of the best short fiction films of the late 20th Century follow Polanski\u2019s lead in telling their stories without dialogue, such as Liz Hughes\u2019s Cat\u2019s Cradle (Australia, 1991, 12 min.), Marianne Olsen Ulrichsen\u2019s Come (Norway, 1995, 4 min. 30 sec.) and Marcell Iv\u00e1nyi\u2019s Wind (Hungary, 1996, 6 min.), to name only three which were presented in earlier issues of p.o.v.[2] There are, however, equally important short fiction films which tell their stories largely on the basis of dialogue, such as Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Coffee and Cigarettes (USA, 1986, 5 min.), Nina Mimica\u2019s The War Is Over (Italy, 1997, 7 min.), Ariel Gordon\u2019s Goodbye Mom (Mexico, 1997, 8 min.),[3] and even more recently, Claude Saint Antoine\u2019s New York Encounter (France, 1998, 2 min. 30 sec.)."},{"music":"demo.mp3","bg":"bg\/city.jpg","text":"Page 2."}]}
